This plugin generates the appropriate ICRA content labels for your site and integrates the information into your site.

== Description ==

ICRA labels are part of a global effort known as the "Semantic Web." That is, a system to make sense of the mass of data available online. Your label is created using the same technology used for things like RSS news feeds. As more and more tools are developed to make the semantic web a reality, labels can play an increasingly important role in making your content visible to users.

Content providers check which of the elements in the questionnaire are present or absent from their websites. This then generates specific meta-tags placed in to the header of the web pages.

Users, especially parents of young children, can then use filtering software to allow or disallow access to web sites based on the information declared in the label. A key point is that ICRA does not rate internet content - the content providers do that, using the ICRA labelling system. ICRA makes no value judgement about sites.

The broad topics covered are:
The presence or absence of nudity
The presence or absence of sexual content
The depiction of violence
The language used
The presence or absence of user-generated content and whether this is moderated
The depiction of other potentially harmful content such as gambling, drugs and alcohol
Within each broad category the web author is asked more detailed questions about whether a specific item or feature is present or absent from the site.
